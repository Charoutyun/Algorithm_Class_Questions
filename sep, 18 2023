Solve the following list using in-place selection sort: 

L = [M,I,C,E]

Using “l” to differentiate between unsorted and sorted 

[| M, I, C, E] 

Iteration 1, 

Selecting ‘c’ as the smallest and moving it to sorted part and incrementhing the unsorted pair

[ C, | M, I, E ]

Iteration 2: 

Selecting ‘E’ 

[ C,E | M, I ]

Iteration 3: 

Selecting ‘I” 

[ C,E,I| M] 

Iteration 4: 

Selecting “M” 

[ C,E,I ,M| ]
